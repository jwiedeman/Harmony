"""Ping cadence validation helpers.

This module implements a very small portion of the timing engine described in
*Harmony Heartbeat+*.  It focuses solely on verifying the cadence of ``ping``
requests during main content and advertisement playback.  The goal is not to be
feature complete but to provide a lightweight utility that unit tests can
exercise.
