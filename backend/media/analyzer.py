"""High level helpers for validating Adobe media sessions.

This module ties together the individual components provided by the
:mod:`backend.media` package â€“ normalization, ordering rules, ping cadence
checks and basic metric calculations.  It exposes convenience functions that
accept either already-normalized :class:`MediaEvent` objects or raw network
log entries.  The functions return a dictionary containing computed metrics and
any validation violations that were detected.

The implementation is intentionally lightweight; it focuses on the pieces
implemented in the test suite (event ordering, ping cadence and simple
metrics).  Additional rules can be layered on later without changing the
public interface.
